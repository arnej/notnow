notnow
======

**notnow** is a terminal based TODO management program (that's right,
yet another). It uses JSON for plain-text storage of a TODO database and
is conceived in the [Rust programming language][rust-lang].


Status
------

The program is in a very early development phase with lots of
anticipated improvements and changes. As such, frequent internal changes
are to be expected. In addition to that, it also acts as the first play
ground for the [gui crate][gui], which explores the design space of UI
applications using Rust.
